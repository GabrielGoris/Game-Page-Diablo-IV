This was a project made for study based on the Diablo IV game page where there's a menu with the "Blizzard" and the "Diablo IV" logos and a navigation menu on the page.
You can click on "comprar" for open a new tab to choose a plataform and open the game page original window.

Scrolling down the page or clicking on "Edições" you'll go to a new section on the page where you can compare the game editions that you can buy!!
